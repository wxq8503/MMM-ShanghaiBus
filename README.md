## MMM-BMW

**Bugger My Weather**

## Same church, different pew

I wanted to take a new approach at a weather module. Until now, I had only done WWI and WWI2 but I
wasn't really happy with those, although they were fun to do. This has a bit more style to it (not much)
and it doesn't resemble other modules in format or appearance. I learned a couple of new things while
doing it and I used what I learned in the module itself. Nothing monumental but very satisfying for me.

## Good-bye bottom_bar or lower_thid

* This was designed for use in the bottom_bar or lower_third position of your MagicMirror
* My first real use of icons in a module, denoting the upcoming forecast
* Weather forecast for day and night
* Only the current weather is written out in words

## Examples

* lower_third position, under compliments

* bottom_bar position

## Installation and requirements

* `git clone https://github.com/mykle1/MMM-BMW` into the `~/MagicMirror/modules` directory.

* Free API key at `https://www.wunderground.com`

* No dependencies needed! No kidding!

## Config.js entry and options

    {
		disabled: false,
		module: "MMM-BMW",
		position: "bottom_bar",               // bottom_bar or lower_third is best

			tempUnits: "C",		              // C of F

            	city: 'New_York',                 // City, eg. New_York (with underscore - no spaces)
			useHeader: false,                 // true if you want a header

		}
	},
